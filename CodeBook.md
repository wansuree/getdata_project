The Code Book
----------------
This is the description on the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.  

"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" was used in this project.  The data were collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data were obtained:

Raw Data
----------------
Part 1: Training data
Cases: 7352
Variables: 561

Part 2: Testing data
Cases: 2947
Variables: 561

For information about the variables, summary choices, and experimental study design, see
* ./data/UCI\ HAR\ Dataset/README.txt
* ./data/UCI\ HAR\ Dataset/features.txt 
* ./data/UCI\ HAR\ Dataset/features_info.txt


Tidy Data
----------------
79 variables: mean() std()
`run_analysis.R` provides a tidy dataset of these data.

Cases: 180
Variables: 81





----------------
* Information about the variables (including units!) in the data set not contained in the tidy data
* Information about the summary choices you made
* Information about the experimental study design you used


** Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?
